# subgroup-stix

OpenC2 defines a language at a level of abstraction that will enable command and control of cyber defense components with enough generality to provide flexibility in the implementations of devices and accommodate future products. The STIX COA sub-working group of OpenC2 looks at how STIX can be used to carry OpenC2 commands in its COA field. 
The group developed XML schemas for Structured COA extensions to STIX 1.x 

The group meets on a bi-weekly basis to discuss topics as they relate to the ongoing versions of STIX.
